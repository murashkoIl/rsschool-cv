## About me
My name is Ilya Murashko. I was born in Belarus, the city of Minsk. At the moment, I am 19 years old and I am studying at the Faculty of Information Technologies and Management at BSUIR. Unfortunately, this path was not for me, so I want to try myself in WEB development, because it is much more interesting for me. At the same time, there is already some knowledge in this area and I am ready to develop further.
